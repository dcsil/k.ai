## ADR 001: React.js & Next.js

## Context

We need to build a frontend and a backend for our product.

Relevant CUJs: CUJ 1-3 on release tasks, CUJ 4 on social media management. These all have a frontend component enabled by React and backend enabled by Next.js.

### Options

Frontend: Vue, Angular, React\
Backend: Django, Springboot, Next.js

## Decision

We decided to use Next.js to support the backend and React for frontend. React’s component-based nature enables building reusable UI elements such as timeline and to-do list, while Next.js provides built-in API routes for prototyping.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

This decision enables rapid MVP development through React’s component libraries and Next.js conventions. This reduces the development timeline for core features like task management and social media scheduling.
