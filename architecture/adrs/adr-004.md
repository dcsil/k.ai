## ADR 004: ayrshare

## Context

Social media management capabilities is a key aspect of our product.

Relevant CUJs: CUJ 4 on social media management.

### Options

Individual platform API implementations OR Hootsuite OR getlate.dev

## Decision

There are three key reasons around this decision:

1) ayrshare supports all platforms supported by Hootsuite and more.

2) ayrshare is an API-based solution. Hootsuite on the other hand is an application exposing its API suite. Since we will only utilize the APIs and not the platform itself, a more specific and targeted solution like ayrshare stands out.

3) Though Hootsuite documentation for the application has strong coverage, its crucially lacking on the API side. ayrshare on the other hand has strong coverage of API documentation.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

Hootsuite offers a student plan that is free but requires verification. We are still in progress for contacting ayrshare for potential student benefits since its free plan only offers 20 posts per month while allowing a single account set to be managed. While ayrshare is a suitable solution at this stage of our development, the team is open to rather affordable options if ayrshare does not accommodate student plans.

## Potential Backups

getlate.dev
