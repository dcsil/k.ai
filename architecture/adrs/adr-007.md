## ADR 007: Gemini

## Context

We need to deploy a LLM model to implement the AI-powered strategy feature that helps our customers get advice on releasing music as independent musicians. Some requirements include:

- Providing practical advice to indie customers’ budget and constraints
- Clear and concise guidance on music release strategies
- Reliable API with good documentation

### Options

1) ChatGPT (OpenAI API)
2) DeepSeek
3) Gemini

## Decision

We will use Gemini 2.5 Flash via Google’s GenAI API.

Reasons for choosing Gemini:

1) The Flash model provides fast response times suitable for real-time chat interactions, while maintaining good quality outputs for the music industry advice use case.
2) Google’s GenAI SDK (`@google/genai`) offers straightforward integration with clean TypeScript support, making implementation and maintenance easier for the team.
3) Gemini offers competitive pricing with a generous free tier, which aligns with our budget constraints as an independent project.

Reasons for not choosing alternatives:

1) OpenAI API has a higher cost structure with no substantial free tier, making it less suitable for the team’s budget.
2) DeepSeek has a less established ecosystem and documentation compared to Google’s GenAI.
3) Overall, the quality difference isn’t significant enough to adjust the additional cost or less-constructed documentation for the specific use case of music release strategy and guidance.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

Using Gemini 2.5 Flash enables us to offer AI-powered music release advice with sustainable free token usage. The fast response times enhance user experience in real-time chat interactions, and the straightforward API integration with TypeScript reduces development complexity. However, the team accepts vendor lock-in to Google's ecosystem and potential rate limits on the free tier that may require monitoring as the user base grows. The quality trade-off compared to premium models like GPT-4 is acceptable for the specific use case of providing music industry guidance.

## Potential Backups

- OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo, if need different response characteristics or hit Gemini limitations.
- Open-source models (such as Llama via Hugging Face), for complete control and no API costs, though would require self-hosting infrastructure.
