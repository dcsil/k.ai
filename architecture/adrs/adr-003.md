## ADR 003: Hootsuite

## Context

Social media management capabilities is a key aspect of our product.

Relevant CUJs: CUJ 4 on social media management.

### Options

Individual platform API implementations OR Ayrshare

## Decision

As Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter (X) are of higher priority platforms for team k.ai and considering the unified api set this application provides as well as benefits for students, we have chosen Hootsuite. Hootsuite is a social media management platform that supports social network integrations for Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, YouTube and TikTok. It has APIs exposed for developers.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

The decision to utilize Hootsuite over individual platform API implementations means we are dependent on this service for future social media management capabilities and this requires regular maintenance and alignment efforts to keep up with potential changes on the tool in the future.
