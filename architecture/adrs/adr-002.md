## ADR 002: Prisma ORM + SQLite

## Context

We will need a database to store our user data and information in the backend. All our CUJs require some kind of data storage functionality to function.

Relevant CUJs: CUJ 1-3 on release tasks, CUJ 4 on social media management, CUJ 5 and 6 on user profile and billing. These all require persistence through a database.

### Options

PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, Prisma ORM, MariaDB, MySQL, â€¦

## Decision

We are choosing to use Prisma ORM in combination with SQLite to serve as our DB for our MVP. We are choosing this option because Prisma is a flexible abstraction layer for various DBs. We are choosing SQLite because at this stage of development, SQLite is a lightweight solution that is suitable for us to quickly make a MVP around.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

By using Prisma ORM and SQLite, we have chosen a more lightweight solution that is simpler for development, but might not have the capacity to scale. This can be potentially be addressed in the future by moving to a different underlying DB while keeping Prisma ORM. This is doable because the Prisma function calls in our code will require no change, and Prisma will translate the same instructions into the new DB.
