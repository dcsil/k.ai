The frontend is made possible by a React web app. It connects to Next.js in the backend. In the MVP, the setup is as allows: the backend connects to a social media management API, specifically Postiz, which allows management of multiple social media platforms. The LLM API is Gemini. For the database, Prisma ORM and SQLite are used. (Longer term features include billing and authentication, which will be enabled by APIs.)
