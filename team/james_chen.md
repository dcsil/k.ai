## About James

"Choose courage over comfort." - Jess Tang / Brene Brown

I'm James, co-founder and developer at k.ai / fifth-year UofT computer science student / computing education researcher / UX designer. But all of my roles would not be possible without the above quote. This call to action to step in and stay in my growth zone has made me more engaged in nearly every aspect of my life â€” whether that is taking a risk to learn a new language with teammates in the midst of a hackathon, or asking to compose the background music of a welcome video for Shad. As I build my first startup, k.ai, I hope to bring courage into my work.

## Strengths

- **Learning new technologies**
    - During my last coop at Media Resources, I learned about technologies for frontend (Angular), backend (Django), database (PostgreSQL), player (Go) to create features within these parts in an ad management system.
- **UX Design** - brainstorming ideas and bringing them into reality
- **Courage** and **reflection** to get me to my goals and those of my team

## Weaknesses (and how I make up for them with my strengths)

- **Public speaking** - I'm working on calming my nervousness and learning pitching skills. I'll continuously practice and reflect this semester.
- **Attunement** / Knowing if someone needs support - Reflecting in the past, sometimes I was unaware when a fellow teammate needs help. For CSC491/454, I will check in with my teammates periodically and stay attuned.
- Lack of knowledge about **some technical skills**, including iOS / Android apps, production and CI/CD infrastructure. I can learn these!
