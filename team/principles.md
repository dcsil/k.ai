# k.ai Principles

## Communication:
- The main communication between group members will be done through a private Discord server: CSC454/491-k.ai.
- It is the responsibility of each group member to regularly check the Discord channel for project updates, meeting times, fellow group member questions, and other related communication.
- Whenever there is an important message, the channel will be pinged. When the message is related to specific group members, they will individually be pinged.
- It is the expectation that all group members will be responsive to each other. However, if a group member is not responsive, they will be messaged directly to regain communication. 
- The main branch of the GitHub repository is protected to prevent accidental edits. This means that this requires at least the approval of 2 team members to add a change to the main branch.
- Organization of GitHub repository
  - k.ai homebase (under DCSIL) (organization is based on A1 handout suggestion)
      - Issues: document questions and product roadmap
      - Pull requests: Changes are made with a PR. We will aim for a response time of 2 business days to PRs.
      - Projects: used for roadmapping (see more information in task delegation)
      - In-repo docs: used for general documentation
  - code repository - contains actual code

## Meetings:
- We will hold weekly meetings on Discord at 6:30 PM every Monday.
- Meeting times will not exceed 8pm, with respect to each team member's night time routine.
- We will schedule extra meetings as needed.
- We will keep track of every meeting’s minutes by using Google Drive. The meeting notes for each meeting will be written in Google docs. The link to our google drive folder is: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1gTPpE_YnzjyPi2QauBsyJWxpi0g-Xlju
- Every team member is expected to attend each meeting (unless it is a meeting intended for members in CSC491). If anyone cannot make it, they need to communicate with the other members as soon as possible. The team should determine if the group will postpone the meeting, or let the absent member catch up after.
- If a member is absent for a meeting, they need to update their progress before the scheduled meeting and are responsible to catch up after.


## Work Delegation:
- The work amount of each team member is expected to be evenly distributed during a team meeting.
- Use GitHub Projects to assign tasks and to-do items to each team member. Individual team members are responsible for updating the status of their current task in the tracker (todo / working on it / stuck / awaiting PR review).
- The team member is responsible for letting the team know if they have difficulties or they are stuck on completing their tasks some time before the deadline, so it will give time for the team to help out.
- Team members are welcome to suggest tasks to work on that they may be interested in to the team.
- Team members can claim tasks that they are interested in, unclaim tasks will be distributed fairly in a way that evens the workload across the team members.
- We will rotate logistical tasks among team members. If a member likes a certain task, they can do it more frequently.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- Each team member is responsible to abide by the agreed upon team principles.
- Each team member is responsible for supporting each other and working toward a common goal.
- Each team member is responsible to complete their share of work, as to not hinder the team’s progress
- Roles will become more defined as the project evolves. They may change throughout the project.
